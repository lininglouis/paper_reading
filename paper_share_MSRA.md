as we get deeper in a CNN, the number of channels rapidly increases (with the increase in the number of filters), while the spatial dimensions decrease (with pooling/strided convolution). Thus in much of the network, the channel dimension will dominate.

the filters with high correlation are learned in a more structured way in the networks with filter group


advantage:
1) regularization
2) filters discernible
3) less computation
